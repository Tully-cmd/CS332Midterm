## The State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act of 2021

 1. What does the new "The State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act of 2021" law do?
 
	The State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act (S. 2520) passed in Congress which
	is now law since 2021, enforces Cybersecurity collaboration between the federal and
	local government entities (state, local, tribal, territorial). More specifically the
	Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will provide training, put in act new policies
	to the local entites, provide hands on technical assistance, and mandate information
	sharing 'about Cybersecurity related risks/indicents' between federal and local entities.
 
 2. Describe how it impacts the Cybersecurity community and penetration testing.
 
	The cost estimate of implementing this law for the next 5 year period is $500,000. This
	might seem strange but in fact the DHS has been already conducting these coordination
	activities and this law is simply codifying what the DHS has already been responsible for
	thus giving them the complete authority to do so. Over the next 5 years there will actually
	be no new operating requirements from S. 2520, but looking onward I suspect that this can
	have two completely different outcomes on Cybersecurity.

	In S. 2520 section F there is heavy emphasis on promoting the security of elections through
	collaboration between chief officals of all government entities to enforce policies and 
	procedures related to the security of election systems. I think that in the long term this
	law is setting the foundation of locking down election systems and treating election systems
	as critical systems themselves using the same security design and procedures that would give
	them the fault tolerance of computers of the likes of that power our infrustructure and send
	send objects to orbit. This is a problem that has caused divide and heart-ache between the 
	American people.

	One direction I see this impacting Cybersecurity and penetration testing in the future is 
	the plethora of openings that need to be filled for Cybersecurity experts working for the 
	DHS and local government entities. Due to the scope of all those jobs that need to be filled 
	and the incompetency of the government to gather these individuals to work for the local
	government and DHS, they will create new standardized education to fill these jobs.
